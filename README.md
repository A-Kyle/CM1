## What is this?

This is a repository for a customized Cloud Model 1 (CM1). 
This custom version of CM1 was originally sourced from version 21.0
and downloaded at https://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/people/bryan/cm1/. 
The customizations included here are available in case anyone
might find them useful. However, the customizations may (perhaps "likely" is a better word)
introduce bugs and problems that a user would not encounter
in the unmodified version of CM1. 

## Active customizations

### External initialization of timed parcel trajectories

With the help of a new file `parcel_list.dat`, a user can specify
the locations and times from which to release passively traced
parcels during model integration. 
The user must set up the `namelist.input` file as before when tracking parcels. 
In the output parcel file, a new field representing the time of parcel release, 
`rtime`, has been added.

#### Known bugs

- An issue related to tracking turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) leads to model crashes when using certain planetary boundary layer schemes.
